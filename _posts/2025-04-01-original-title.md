I was going about my life doing sothing of consequence when I thought to buy a sandwich. 
Now some of you may think the triagle shaped packaging could be illuminati related, 
but that's not the point of this post. 
What I wanted to share was the fact that the packaging was half plastic and half paper,
and I just felt like such a hero because I separated the two before I threw them away.
